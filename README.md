# ACFT-Calculator-


The ACFT or Army Combat Fitness Test is the fitness test used for US Army Soldiers. It consists of six events, which are a maximum deadlift, a standing power throw of a 
10 pound ball, hand release push ups, sprint drag carry (sprinting mixed with carrying weights), leg tucks and a two mile run. 

I used vanilla JS and HTML to make a quick rough draft of a future Rect Native project. The user types in their raw scores (weight lifted, time ran, reps performed etc) on each event and presses a button to get the total score (100 points per event for a perfect score of 600).
